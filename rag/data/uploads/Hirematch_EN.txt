Overview

The project started as a cloud-based prototype and is planned for migration to a homelab environment. The focus is to combine objective ranking with clear, actionable explanations.

An AI-powered ATS simulator that evaluates alignment between a resume and a job description, generating a score and practical improvement recommendations.

⸻

Core Objective

Fit Clarity

Make ATS decisions more transparent and actionable.

⸻

Input Modes

2 Modes

Comparison against a job database or a custom job description.

⸻

Technology

NLP + LLM

Semantic extraction + retriever for scoring, and LLM for feedback generation.

⸻

Infrastructure

Cloud-Based

Running on GCP Cloud Run with a basic CI/CD build triggered on every commit.

The Problem

Turning ATS Uncertainty into Actionable Signals

Most candidates receive little to no feedback from automated screening systems. HireMatch AI converts this opaque logic into a transparent score and direct recommendations.

The goal is not just to rank resumes, but to explain how and why a profile aligns with — or diverges from — a specific job opportunity.

Approach

Two Comparison Modes for Practical Use

Users can compare against an existing job database or submit a custom job description. This supports both benchmarking and targeted preparation for a real application.

The scoring layer is combined with LLM-generated feedback to ensure recommendations remain objective and readable.
	•	Mode selection page (job database vs. custom job)
	•	Resume-job comparison screen highlighting skills and requirements

Platform Direction

From Cloud Prototype to Self-Hosted Integration

The project began as a cloud-hosted implementation and is planned to integrate with a homelab stack.

This transition improves operational control, reduces recurring costs, and increases experimentation capacity across infrastructure and AI.

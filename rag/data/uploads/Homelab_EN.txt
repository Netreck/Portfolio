Personal Homelab

A 24/7 self-hosted platform for real-world practice and deployment of my projects.

This project is my hands-on platform engineering lab and the environment where I host my personal projects. It combines a VPS with a public IP and a private home infrastructure (a real physical server) to experiment under real-world constraints.

I started this challenge to better understand the development and maintenance processes of projects within my field of interest.

Overview

This homelab is exposed to the internet through the public IP of a VPS. Inside the environment, I use Nginx Proxy Manager as a reverse proxy to connect each subdomain to one of my Proxmox virtual machines.

Additionally, I use the Grafana, Prometheus, and Loki stack for observability, monitoring logs and access across the homelab.

A residential infrastructure designed with production-grade standards to continuously host personal services — validating architecture, reliability, and operations.

Availability

24/7

Workloads are always active to simulate real operations and maintenance scenarios.

⸻

Edge Model

Minimal VPS

A low-cost, low-complexity public entry point.

⸻

Runtime

Proxmox VE

A combined VM and LXC container strategy running on a single host.

⸻

Observability

Grafana Stack

Aggregated metrics and logs for service visibility.

How It’s Exposed to the Internet

This routing path exists because my ISP uses CGNAT, which prevents the homelab from receiving a direct public IPv4 address.

A VPS with a public IPv4 is used as the internet entry point, and traffic is securely forwarded to the home network.

Traffic Flow
	1.	User Request
A user attempts to access a service published by the homelab.
	2.	Cloudflare DNS
The domain is resolved through Cloudflare DNS before routing.
	3.	VPS Public IP
Traffic reaches the public VPS acting as the internet edge.
	4.	Caddy TLS Gateway (VPS)
Caddy terminates TLS and forwards requests through a secure tunnel.
	5.	Nginx Proxy Manager (Proxmox)
Inside the home network, Nginx Proxy Manager routes traffic to internal services.

Designing with Real Constraints

The main architectural decision was driven by an ISP limitation: CGNAT makes direct exposure difficult and costly.

Instead of overengineering the edge, I intentionally kept the VPS minimal to act purely as a public gateway.

From there, traffic is securely forwarded to the homelab via WireGuard, keeping private services outside the public surface while maintaining a predictable access pattern.

Infrastructure

Virtualization as the Operational Core

Proxmox is the foundation of the environment, running VMs and LXC containers according to each workload’s needs.

This ensures clear isolation while maintaining efficient resource usage.

Core building blocks include:
	•	Reverse proxy
	•	Storage
	•	DNS
	•	Application workloads

Operations

Monitoring-Driven Workflow

I treat the homelab as a production-grade platform, so visibility is mandatory.

ProxMenuX accelerates host-level diagnostics, and Grafana provides deeper insight into service health.

This observability-first model reduces trial and error during incidents and enables safer iteration cycles.
